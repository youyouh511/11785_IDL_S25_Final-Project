# 11785_IDL_S25_Final-Project

## Overview

This assignment is to reimplement the work by Zhao et al.(2024) (https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08414), building a model to predict wildfire danger in European regions featured by Mediterranean and Boreal biomes, using data from SeasFire (https://zenodo.org/records/13834057).

## Data preprocessing
Data used for eventual implementation
```bash
restricted_sampling.ipynb
```
Data collection without filtering rules set by this reimplementation project
```bash

```

## Main
Streamline process for training (adhoc errors possible due to environment setup and bugs from merging different team members' work)
```bash
